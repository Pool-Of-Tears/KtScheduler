**KtScheduler** is a lightweight task/job scheduling library for Kotlin, powered by Kotlin coroutines! The design of this library is inspired by the [APScheduler](https://github.com/agronholm/apscheduler) library for Python, while keeping things simple and easy to use.

------

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Add the Jitpack repository in your build configuration:

```kotlin
repositories {
    ...
    maven { url 'https://www.jitpack.io' }
}
```

Add the dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.starry-shivam:KtScheduler:Tag'
}
```

------

### Documentation üìë

Here's a quick start:

```kotlin
val timeZone = ZoneId.of("Asia/Kolkata")
val scheduler = KtScheduler(timeZone = timeZone)

val job = Job(
    jobId = "OneTimeJob", // Must be unique for each job
    function = { println("OneTime Job executed at ${ZonedDateTime.now(timeZone)}") },
    trigger = OneTimeTrigger(ZonedDateTime.now(timeZone).plusSeconds(5)),
    // Next runtime of the job; when creating the job for the first time, it will be used as the initial runtime.
    nextRunTime = ZonedDateTime.now(timeZone).plusSeconds(5),
    // Coroutine dispatcher in which the job should be executed.
    dispatcher = Dispatchers.Default
)

scheduler.addJob(job)
scheduler.start()

// If you're running this as a standalone program, you need to block the current thread
// to prevent the program from exiting, since scheduler.start() is a non-blocking call.
scheduler.idle()
```

#### Triggers

Triggers determine when and at what frequency a particular job should be executed. KtScheduler provides four types of triggers:

1. `CronTrigger` - A trigger that determines the next run time based on the specified days of the week and time.

```kotlin
// Days when the job should fire
val daysOfWeek = setOf(DayOfWeek.MONDAY, DayOfWeek.WEDNESDAY, DayOfWeek.FRIDAY)
// 10:00 AM | Time of the day when the job should fire
val time = LocalTime.of(10, 0)

val trigger = CronTrigger(daysOfWeek, time)
```

2. `DailyTrigger` - A trigger that fires at a specific time every day.

```kotlin
// Run daily at 10:00 AM
val dailyTime = LocalTime.of(10, 0)
val trigger = DailyTrigger(dailyTime)
```

3. `IntervalTrigger` - A trigger that fires at a specified interval.

```kotlin
val interval = 60L // Every 60 seconds
val trigger = IntervalTrigger(interval)
```

4. `OneTimeTrigger` - A trigger that fires once at a specified time.

```kotlin
val timeZone = ZoneId.of("Asia/Kolkata")
// Run after 5 seconds
val trigger = OneTimeTrigger(ZonedDateTime.now(timeZone).plusSeconds(5))
```

##### Creating Your Own Trigger

You can easily create your own custom trigger by implementing the `Trigger` interface.
Here's an example to create a `WeekendTrigger`, a trigger that should fire on weekends at a specified time.

```kotlin

import dev.starry.ktscheduler.triggers.Trigger

class WeekendTrigger(private val time: LocalTime) : Trigger {
    private val weekendDays = setOf(DayOfWeek.SATURDAY, DayOfWeek.SUNDAY)

    override fun getNextRunTime(currentTime: ZonedDateTime, timeZone: ZoneId): ZonedDateTime {
        var nextRunTime = currentTime.withZoneSameInstant(timeZone).with(time).withNano(0)

        while (!weekendDays.contains(nextRunTime.dayOfWeek) ||
            nextRunTime.isBefore(currentTime) ||
            nextRunTime.isEqual(currentTime)
        ) {
            nextRunTime = nextRunTime.plusDays(1)
        }

        return nextRunTime
    }
}
```

#### Listening for Job Events

You can listen for job events such as completion or failure due to errors by attaching a `JobEventListener` to the `KtScheduler`. Here's an example:

```kotlin
import dev.starry.ktscheduler.event.JobEvent
import dev.starry.ktscheduler.event.JobEventListener

class MyEventListener : JobEventListener {
    override fun onJobComplete(event: JobEvent) {
        println("Job ${event.jobId} completed successfully at ${event.timestamp}")
    }

    override fun onJobError(event: JobEvent) {
        println("Job ${event.jobId} failed with exception ${event.exception} at ${event.timestamp}")
    }
}

val eventListener = MyEventListener()
scheduler.addEventListener(eventListener)
```
